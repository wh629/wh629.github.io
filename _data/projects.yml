 description: "Performance on the Winograd Schema Challenge (WSC), a respected commonsense reasoning benchmark, recently rocketed from chance accuracy to 89% on the SuperGLUE leaderboard, with relatively little corroborating evidence of a correspondingly large improvement in reasoning ability. We hypothesize part of this improvement comes from recent changes in task formalization by users of the dataset: the combination of input specification, loss function, and the way pretrained parameters are used. We perform an ablation on two Winograd Schema datasets that interpolates between the two formalizations used before and after this surge, and find (i) framing the task as multiple choice improves performance dramatically and (ii) several additional techniques, including the reuse of a pretrained language modeling head, can mitigate the model’s extreme sensitivity to hyperparameters. The impact of task formalization may result in overly optimistic reports of improved commonsense reasoning performance. We urge future benchmark creators to impose additional structure to minimize the impact of formalization decisions on reported results."

 # description: "A growing body of work shows that models exploit annotation artifacts to achieve state-of-the-art performance on standard crowdsourced benchmarks—datasets collected from crowd-workers to create an evaluation task—while still failing on out-of-domain examples for the same task. Recent work has explored theuse of counterfactually-augmented data—data built by minimally editing a set of seed examples to yield counterfactual labels—to augment training data associated with these benchmarks and build more robust classifiers that generalize better. However, Khashabi et al. (2020) find that this type of augmentation yields little benefit on reading comprehension tasks when controlling for dataset size and cost of collection. We build upon this work by using English natural language inference data to test model generalization and robustness and find that models trained on a counterfactually-augmented SNLI dataset do not generalize better than unaugmented datasets of similar size and that counterfactual augmentation can hurt performance, yielding models that are less robust to challenge examples. Counterfactual augmentation of natural language understanding data through standard crowdsourcing techniques does not appear to be an effective way of collecting training data and further innovation is required to make this general line of work viable."
