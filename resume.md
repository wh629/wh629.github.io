# Research &amp; Professional Experience

#### Machine Learning for Language (ML<sup>2</sup>); New York, NY

*Research Assistant* advised by Prof. Samuel R. Bowman (Sep 2020 --- Present)

- Researched the use of Item Response Theory (IRT) as a method to evaluate the relative difficulties of NLP benchmarks

- Developed a program using Pyro to apply black-box Variational Inference to fit an IRT model to a set of machine responses by experimenting with different prior and posterior approximation assumptions



*Collaborator* (Jun 2020 --- Sep 2020)

- Built a custom task sampler with PyTorch to investigate the effect of batching highly similar data during training
- Curated a set of annotated natural language datasets based on reasoning criteria for a comparison of evaluation tasks



#### American International Group, Inc (AIG); New York, NY

*Enterprise Risk Management Analyst II* (Mar 2019 --- Jun 2019)

- Analyzed AIG's loss distribution to estimate each subsidiary's required capital to buffer against financial downturn
- Managed quarterly capital estimation and firm wide reporting to key stakeholders including the Chief Risk Officer
- Presented key risk profile changes to senior stakeholders to highlight the impact of business activities and market movements



*Enterprise Risk Management Analyst* (Aug 2016 --- Mar 2019)

- Researched and tested model enhancements such as the use of financial correlations under different interest rate regimes to improve capital estimation stability
- Led a team of multinational analysts to migrate portions of AIG's capital model from Excel to Python as part of a cross-functional collaboration with IT
- Analyzed the risk impact of significant transactions such as the \$5.6B acquisition of Validus Holdings Ltd and the reinsurance pact with Berkshire Hathaway, covering roughly half of AIG's \$34B U.S. property and casualty reserves



# Projects

#### Counterfactually-Augmented NLI Data

(Jun 2020 --- Aug 2020)

- Researched the use of counterfactually-augmented natural language inference (NLI) training data to improve generalization to out-of-domain problems
- Analyzed properties of counterfactually-augmented NLI training data by evaluating RoBERTa-based models on a set of diagnostic examples to test both linguistic ability and robustness to distractors



#### Task Sensitivity to Problem Formalization

(Feb 2020 --- Jun 2020)

- Coordinated several hundred training runs on New York University's high performance computer cluster to train RoBERTa-based models on seven Winograd Schema Challenge (WSC) task formalizations
- Analyzed and visualized results using Pandas and Matplotlib to perform an ablation analysis between two popular WSC formalizations and attribute the 6% difference in test accuracy



#### Embeddings for Continual Learning

(Feb 2020 --- May 2020)

- Designed an experiment to test a meta-learning algorithm to learn BERT embeddings robust against catastrophic forgetting
- Developed a program using PyTorch and Huggingface's Transformers libraries to train BERT-based models on a continual learning curriculum of QA tasks and perform our meta-learning experiment



#### Fake Review Detection with Contextual Embeddings

(Feb 2020 --- May 2020)

- Tested various contextual embedding models on real-life fake review detection to gauge the performance of ALBERT, BERT, and RoBERTa
- Examined review data to understand feature distributions and mine for user statistics to further discriminate reviews



#### Unsupervised Document Clustering

(Feb 2020 --- Mar 2020)

- Built a textual data processing pipeline in Java with the StanfordNLP package to read, tokenize, and vectorize documents with term frequency-inverse document frequency (TF-IDF) in preparation for unsupervised clustering
- Implemented K-Means clustering to group similar documents and performed PCA decomposition for 2D cluster visualization



# Teaching
